The n Queens Problem is a mathematical game in which the player attempts to place n queens on an
n Ã— n chessboard such that no two queens may attack each other. The game was invented about 170 years
ago and has been studied by many mathematicians and computer scientists, including such luminaries as
Carl Gauss.
this is an implemented solver for the 8 Queens Problem. 

In the game of chess, a queen can move (and attack) any unobstructed position in the same row, column,
or diagonal from her starting position. Thus, all solutions to 8 Queens (there are 92 of them) have exactly
one queen in each row, column, and diagonal of the chessboard.
